Recently, there has been an increase in the number of building collapse in Lagos and major cities in Nigeria. Olusola Insurance Company offers a building insurance policy that protects buildings against damages that could be caused by a fire or vandalism, by a flood or storm.

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not

The model will be based on the building characteristics. The target variable, Claim, is a:

1 if the building has at least a claim over the insured period.
0 if the building doesnâ€™t have a claim over the insured period.
